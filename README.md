# MSU Schedule Builder Chrome Extension

This is a Google Chrome extension that runs on the Michigan State University schedule builder website (https://schedule.msu.edu/). The extension leverages
the external website msugrades.com, which provides grade information including median and average GPA for each course and professor. This extension provides a 
way to compare professors GPA for specific courses directly on the schedule builder site.
